### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Risk Strategy, Policy & Compliance professional with 5 years of experience in risk assessment, business continuity planning, and audit compliance. I have completed a rigorous Cybersecurity boot camp and earned my CompTIA Security+ certification, and am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a new role with emphasis on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).
